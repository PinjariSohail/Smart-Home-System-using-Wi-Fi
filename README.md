# Smart Home-System-using-Wi-Fi

This project presents an Intelligent and Automated Smart Home System that enables users to remotely control and monitor home appliances using a mobile application over Wi-Fi communication. The system is designed around an ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the core controller and establishes wireless communication between connected home devices and the user’s smartphone. Appliances like lights, fans, air conditioning units, or other electronic devices can be controlled with just a tap on the mobile app. This project eliminates the need for manual switches and allows the user to access their appliances from any location, as long as they are connected to the internet.

The smart home system focuses on user convenience, personalization, and energy efficiency. It allows users to customize settings based on their preferences — such as setting timers, scheduling appliance usage, or defining operating conditions — making the home environment more adaptive and user-friendly. For example, lights can automatically turn off when no one is in the room, or fans can be triggered based on temperature levels. This not only improves comfort but also contributes to reducing power consumption. The project can be expanded further with voice assistant integration (like Google Assistant or Alexa), real-time energy monitoring, or even motion sensors for automation. Overall, it demonstrates a cost-effective and scalable solution for modern smart living.
